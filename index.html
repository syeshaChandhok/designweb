                    <p class="card-description">Depressive disorder (also know as depression) is a common mental
                        disorder. It involves a depressed mood or loss of pleasure or interest in activities for long
                        periods of time. Depression is different from regular mood changes and feelings about everyday
                        life.</p>

                        A panic attack is a brief episode of intense anxiety, which causes the physical sensations of
                        fear. These can include a racing heartbeat, shortness of breath, dizziness, trembling and muscle
                        tension. Panic attacks occur frequently and unexpectedly and are often not related to any
                        external threat.</p>

                    <p class="card-description">While common definitions of loneliness describe it as a state of
                        solitude or being alone, loneliness is actually a state of mind. Loneliness causes people to
                        feel empty, alone, and unwanted. People who are lonely often crave human contact, but their
                        state of mind makes it more difficult to form connections with others.</p>
